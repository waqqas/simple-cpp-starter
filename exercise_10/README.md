# Copy Elision

Copy elision is an optimization technique used by C++ compilers to eliminate unnecessary copying or moving of objects. It allows the compiler to omit copy and move constructors, resulting in more efficient code.

## Key points about copy elision:

1. **Return Value Optimization (RVO)**: When a function returns a local object by value, the compiler can construct the object directly in the caller's stack frame, avoiding a copy.

2. **Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO)**: Similar to RVO, but applies to named local objects being returned.

3. **Temporary Object Elision**: When a temporary object is used to initialize another object, the compiler can construct the object directly in its final location.

4. **Mandatory in certain cases**: C++17 made copy elision mandatory in some situations, even if the copy/move constructors have side effects.

5. **Performance improvement**: Copy elision can significantly improve performance by reducing unnecessary object copies and moves.

## Example:


class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() { std::cout << "Constructor\n"; }
    MyClass(const MyClass&) { std::cout << "Copy Constructor\n"; }
};

MyClass createObject() {
    return MyClass(); // Copy elision may occur here
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj = createObject(); // Copy elision may occur here
    return 0;
}


In this example, the compiler may eliminate the copy operations when creating and returning the `MyClass` object, potentially outputting only "Constructor" once.

Copy elision is a powerful optimization technique that helps write more efficient C++ code without sacrificing readability or expressiveness.


## Copy and Move Assignment Operators

In addition to copy elision, C++ provides copy and move assignment operators for efficient object manipulation. These operators are crucial for managing resources and optimizing performance.

### Copy Assignment Operator

The copy assignment operator `operator=` is used to copy the contents of one object to another existing object of the same class.

Key points:
1. Signature: `MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other)`
2. Creates a deep copy of the source object
3. Handles self-assignment
4. Returns a reference to the current object

Example:


class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            // Perform deep copy
        }
        return *this;
    }
};


### Move Assignment Operator

The move assignment operator `operator=` is used to transfer ownership of resources from one object to another, typically with rvalue references.

Key points:
1. Signature: `MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept`
2. Efficiently transfers resources instead of copying
3. Leaves the source object in a valid but unspecified state
4. Often implemented as a "steal" operation

Example:


class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
        if (this != &other) {
            // Transfer ownership of resources
            // Reset other's resources
        }
        return *this;
    }
};


Both assignment operators are essential for writing efficient and resource-safe C++ code, complementing the optimization techniques like copy elision.
