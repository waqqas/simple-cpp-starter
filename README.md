## Building the Project with CMake

To build the project using CMake, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Create a new directory called `build` (or any other name you prefer) to store the build files.
4. Change into the `build` directory.
5. Run the CMake command to generate the build files. The command should be in the format `cmake <path_to_source>`, where `<path_to_source>` is the path to the root directory of the project.
6. Once the CMake command completes successfully, you can proceed to build the project using the appropriate build tool for your platform (e.g., `make` on Linux, `msbuild` on Windows).
7. Run the build command. The command may vary depending on your platform and build tool. For example, on Linux, you can use the `make` command to build the project by running `make`.
8. If the build process completes without errors, you should now have the executable or library file generated in the build directory.

That's it! You have successfully built the project using CMake.
