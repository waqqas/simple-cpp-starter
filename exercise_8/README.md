# C++ Classes

Classes are a fundamental concept in C++ that allow you to create user-defined data types. They encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data into a single unit.

Key features of C++ classes:

1. Data members: Variables that hold the object's state.
2. Member functions: Functions that operate on the object's data.
3. Access specifiers: Control the visibility of class members (public, private, protected).
4. Constructors and destructors: Special functions for initializing and cleaning up objects.
5. Inheritance: Allows classes to inherit properties and methods from other classes.

Basic syntax:


class ClassName {
private:
    // Private data members and functions
public:
    // Public data members and functions
    ClassName(); // Constructor
    ~ClassName(); // Destructor
};


Classes provide a way to implement object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.
