 Function Overloading in C++
 ---
 
 * Function overloading is a feature in C++ that allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to be defined. 

 * The compiler determines which function to call based on the number, types, and order of the arguments passed to the function.

 * Function overloading provides a way to create functions that perform similar operations but with different input parameters, making the code more readable and modular.

 * To overload a function, you need to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. 

 * The functions can have different return types, but the parameter lists must differ in either the number of parameters or the types of parameters.

 * When calling an overloaded function, the compiler matches the arguments to the appropriate function based on the function's parameter list.

 * If an exact match is not found, the compiler tries to find the best match by performing implicit conversions or promotions.

 * It is important to note that function overloading is resolved at compile-time, not at runtime. 

 * Therefore, the appropriate function to call is determined during the compilation process based on the function's signature.

 * Function overloading is a powerful feature in C++ that allows you to write more expressive and flexible code by providing multiple versions of a function that can handle different types or numbers of arguments.
